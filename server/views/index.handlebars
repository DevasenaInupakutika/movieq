This should simply have a big text box that does a real-time search against TMDB and return a list of titles.  Selecting the title should populate a hidden field along with the title in the box.
<br/><br/>
Submit button should pass the hidden field which is used to do a lookup against the API by id and populate the data in the mongoDB database with the data returned.
